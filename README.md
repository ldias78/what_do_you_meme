# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Project name - WHAT DO YOU MEME? - Luciane D. and Diana S.

## Team members (Diana S.) https://gist.github.com/sorindevops/2de801a89f2c0d9b351a078826650e55

Project Type:
- Game app

Main Front-end Technology:
- Javascript/React

Main Back-end Technology:
- SQL/Python/Postgres 

Deployment:
- Google Firebase

## Project Description:
The rules are simple. 
- Each round, a rotating judge(computer ramdonly pick a card) plays a Photo Card with a MEME
- Each player gets 7 captions card randomly picked by the computer
- The cards should be private, no one else can see the cards except the player.
- Based in the Meme card everyone plays a Caption Card from the 7 captions card. 
- When the playear play a card, another card should automatically added to the player cards, the playear should always have 7 caption cards.
- The cards should be in secret until clicked on a bottom that would reveal all the cards at the same time.
- Everyone should vote to the funniest and most appropriated card for the MEME
- The card that gets the most vote should score a point, if there is a tie both players get the points in the round
- Lather, rinse, repeat.


1.  An App feature
    - pick cards with random captions
2.  Another App feature
    - pick random Memes 
    
  PS - I added google firebase as a new technology but if it is not enough I can add MySQL instead of Postgres. Please let me know if google firebase is enough.
